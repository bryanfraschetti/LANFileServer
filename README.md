# LAN File Server

An intranet application built using Docker, C#, and ASP.NET that can transfer files from M2M.

## Inspiration

Secure file transfer: No intermediate third party/cloud hosting service needed \
No longer limited by the maximum file size that can be transferred via email \
No file compression, which is often an artifact of using third party services
